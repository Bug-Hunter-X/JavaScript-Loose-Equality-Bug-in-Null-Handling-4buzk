# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to loose equality (`==`) when handling null values.  The provided `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the problem by using strict equality (`===`).

## The Problem

The original code intends to handle null values gracefully. However, it only explicitly checks for strict equality (`===`) with `null`.  If either `a` or `b` is 0 or "", it will still execute the addition, despite possibly being an unintended behavior.

## The Solution

The solution uses strict equality (`===`) to explicitly check for null, undefined, or other unexpected values, ensuring only valid numeric values are used in the addition operation.  Using strict equality improves the code's clarity and reliability.
